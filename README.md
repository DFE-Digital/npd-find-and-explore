The Find and explore data in the National Pupil Database (NPD) service allows users to explore, search and find metadata contained in the NPD.

The NPD has over 22 million records, collected since 1995, and includes pupil level research data including demographics, attendance and exclusion records, grades, information on free school meals.

The service will allow people to get a much clearer understand of the breadth of data available.

#### Vision for this service

A clear way for users to comprehend the data they need to undertake quality research with high public benefit, whilst protecting the privacy of pupils.

## Prerequisites

#### Native

- Ruby 2.6.1
- Node ~v10
- Yarn >1.12
- PostgreSQL 10.1

#### Docker

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setting up the app in development

#### Native

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`, and update the database credentials to match your local setup.
3. Run `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies.
4. Run `bundle exec rails db:setup` to create a development and testing database.
5. Run `bundle exec rails db:seed` to seed the development database with sample data.
6. Run `bundle exec rails server` to launch the app on http://localhost:3000.

#### Docker

> Developing in Docker is currently quite cumbersome â€“ the webpack build process happens for each frontend change as part of the web request, and is *very* slow. It's easier at the moment to develop natively or using a hybrid approach (detailed below).

First, copy `.env.template` to `.env`, and update the database password.

Run this in a shell and leave it running:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The first time you run the app, you need to set up the databases. In a new terminal:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec rails db:setup"
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

#### Hybrid

To get around the complexities of running webpacker in Docker (pull requests to resolve this welcome ðŸ˜‰), yarn rebuilds, etc., we can run the supporting services in Docker, and run webpacker/rails natively.

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres postgres_test
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

In another terminal:
```bash
./bin/rails s
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Admin

We use the [rails_admin gem](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) to provide an easy-to-use back-office interface to manage our data. This has it's challenges (GOV.UK styling for a start), but helps us get off the ground quickly.

The admin interface is accessible through http://localhost:3000/admin in development.

## Running specs
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

## Style & Linting

We follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md), and lint with the `govuk-lint` gem, which is a wrapper around Rubocop:

```bash
bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby

or

docker-compose run --rm web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby"
```

## Import data

Import data items from NPD data tables.

```
DfEDataTables::DataElementParsers::DataElementsLoader.new('path-to-your-NPD-data-tables')
```

Import categories and concepts from a specifically prepared categories excel
file.

```
DfEDataTables::CategoriesLoader.new('path-to-your-categories-excel-file')
```

### EditorConfig

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) to retain consistency beyond Rubocop. There's great support for most editors (e.g. the SublimeText plugin can auto-fix on save).

## Accessibility

Accessibility should be at the heart of what we build. As well as automated accessibility testing with [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y), we're carrying out ongoing accessibility-focussed user research.

## Internationalisation

The NPD only contains data on schools in England, however that doesn't mean English is the first language of researchers working on the NPD. Our first iterations are being built with English as the primary language, but we leverage the [Rails I18n API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) to retain flexibility to make the Find & Explore service multilingual in future.

We use the [globalize gem](https://github.com/globalize/globalize) to provide I18n for dynamic content in models.

## Static pages

We use the [high_voltage gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) to make it easy to build static pages without needing a custom controller/routes. For an example see the [service start page](app/views/pages/service_start.html.erb) and check out the documentation.
