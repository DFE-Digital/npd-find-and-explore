      The National Pupil Database (NPD) is a key DfE data store covering education, skills and children services data for individual learners in England.

    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to use the tool</h2>

    <p>There are two ways you can explore the type of data the NPD holds:</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Browsing via categories</h3>

    <p>
      If you are a new user, you might find it easier to browse the tool using the four high level categories: Attainment, Demographics, Absence and Exclusion, and Children in need and children looked after.
      You would then search for smaller and smaller categories until you found the group of data items you are interested in.
      For example, the <strong>‘Authorised absence due to study leave’</strong> category contains 6 similar data items.
      You can also find specific categories using a simple text search.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Browsing via datasets</h3>

    <p>
    If you are a more experienced user, you may want to search for the data items you are interested in using the names of the DfE collections as we hold them in the NPD.
    There are 23 collections within NPD – for example the termly School Census.
