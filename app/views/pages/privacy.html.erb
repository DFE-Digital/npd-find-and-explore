    <p>Find and explore is provided by the Department for Education (DfE). The DfE is the data controller for pages starting with 'find-npd-data.education.gov.uk'<p>
    <p>If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Be the data controller</li>
      <li>Be responsible for processing any data you share with them</li>
      <li>Publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h2>

    <p>The personal data we collect from you includes:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact us</li>
      <li>how you use our emails - for example whether you open them and which links you click on</li>
      <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of web browser you used</li>
      <li>information on how you use the site, using <%= link_to 'cookies', page_path(:cookies) %> and page tagging techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. This includes IP addresses. The data is anonymised before being used for analytics processing.</p>

    <p>Google Analytics processes anonymised information about:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the pages you visit on Find and explore</li>
      <li>how long you spend on each page</li>
      <li>how you got to the site</li>
      <li>what you interact with while you're visiting the site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address) and we take steps to ensure that this information is not used, or combined with other datasets, to identify who you are.</p>

    <p>We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they’re effective and to detect any weaknesses.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we need this data</h2>

    <p>We collect information through Google Analytics to see how you use the site and government digital services. We do this to help:</p>
